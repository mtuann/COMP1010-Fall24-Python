    "## Lab 8: Tuples and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tuples\n",
    "A **tuple** is an immutable ordered collection of elements. Tuples are defined by placing elements in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, \"apple\")\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dictionaries\n",
    "A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It allows for fast retrieval of values based on their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Create a tuple with your three favorite fruits and print the second fruit.\n",
    "2. Write a program that counts the frequency of each character in a string using a dictionary.\n",
    "3. Explain the differences between tuples and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 9: Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to Sorting\n",
    "Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Bubble Sort\n",
    "A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bubble_sort(arr):\n",
    "    n = len(arr)\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n",
    "            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n",
    "                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n",
    "    return arr\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n",
    "print(bubble_sort(numbers))  # Output: Sorted list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Quick Sort\n",
    "A more efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quick_sort(arr):\n",
    "    if len(arr) <= 1:\n",
    "        return arr\n",
    "    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n",
    "    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n",
    "    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n",
    "    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n",
    "    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(quick_sort(numbers))  # Output: Sorted list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm.\n",
    "2. Compare the time complexity of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.\n",

    "            max_value = num\n",
    "    return max_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recursive Algorithms\n",
    "Recursive algorithms solve problems by calling themselves with smaller inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
