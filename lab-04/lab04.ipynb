    "## Introduction to Strings\n",
    "Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They are used to represent text in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating strings\n",
    "string1 = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "string2 = 'Python is fun!'\n",
    "print(string1)\n",
    "print(string2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Characteristics:\n",
    "- Strings are immutable: Once created, they cannot be changed.\n",
    "- Strings can be indexed and sliced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Manipulation Techniques\n",
    "Python provides various methods to manipulate strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Accessing Characters:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(my_string[0])  # H\n",
    "print(my_string[-1])  # o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Slicing Strings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_string[1:4])  # ell\n",
    "print(my_string[:3])    # Hel\n",
    "print(my_string[2:])    # llo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. String Methods:\n",
    "- **`len()`**: Returns the length of the string.\n",
    "- **`.lower()`**: Converts string to lowercase.\n",
    "- **`.upper()`**: Converts string to uppercase.\n",
    "- **`.replace(old, new)`**: Replaces substrings.\n",
    "- **`.split(separator)`**: Splits string into a list.\n",
    "- **`.join(iterable)`**: Joins elements of an iterable into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample_string = \"Python Programming\"\n",
    "print(\"Length:\", len(sample_string))  # 18\n",
    "print(\"Lowercase:\", sample_string.lower())  # python programming\n",
    "print(\"Uppercase:\", sample_string.upper())  # PYTHON PROGRAMMING\n",
    "print(\"Replaced:\", sample_string.replace(\"Programming\", \"Language\"))  # Python Language\n",
    "print(\"Split:\", sample_string.split(\" \"))  # ['Python', 'Programming']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Functions\n",
    "Testing is an essential part of programming to ensure code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Writing Test Cases\n",
    "You can use assertions to test the expected outcomes of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test cases\n",
    "assert add(2, 3) == 5, \"Test Case 1 Failed\"\n",
    "assert add(-1, 1) == 0, \"Test Case 2 Failed\"\n",
    "assert add(0, 0) == 0, \"Test Case 3 Failed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"All test cases pass\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using `unittest` Framework\n",
    "The `unittest` module provides a framework for creating and running tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "    def test_multiply(self):\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(multiply(3, 4), 12)\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(multiply(-1, 1), -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging Techniques\n",
    "Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using Print Statements\n",
    "You can insert print statements to check variable values at different stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    print(f\"Dividing {a} by {b}\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 2)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using Python Debugger (`pdb`)\n",
    "Python includes a built-in debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variable states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_area(radius):\n",
    "    pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint\n",
    "    return 3.14 * radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "area = calculate_area(5)\n",
    "print(\"Area:\", area)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Exercises\n",
    "1. **String Manipulation Exercise**:\n",
    "   - Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def reverse_string(s):\n",
    "       return s[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(reverse_string(\"Hello\"))  # Output: olleH\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing Exercise**:\n",
    "   - Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome and create test cases to verify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def is_palindrome(s):\n",
    "       return s == s[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Test cases\n",
    "   assert is_palindrome(\"radar\") == True\n",
    "   assert is_palindrome(\"hello\") == False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debugging Exercise**:\n",
    "   - Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Intentionally introduce an error, then use print statements or `pdb` to debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def factorial(n):\n",
    "       if n == 0:\n",
    "           return 1\n",
    "       return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
    "   ```"

    "## Using Breakpoints in PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Open Your Project\n",
    "1. Launch **PyCharm** and open your existing project or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Write or Open Your Code\n",
    "1. Write your Python code or open the existing file you want to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def factorial(n):\n",
    "       if n == 0:\n",
    "           return 1\n",
    "       return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(factorial(5))  # This will calculate 5! (120)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set a Breakpoint\n",
    "1. **Set a Breakpoint**: Click in the gutter (the left margin) next to the line number where you want the program to pause execution. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint has been set.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. You can set multiple breakpoints if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Start the Debugger\n",
    "1. **Run in Debug Mode**: Right-click on your Python file in the Project tool window or the editor and select **Debug 'your_script_name'**. Alternatively, you can click on the green bug icon in the top right corner of the PyCharm window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Debugging Interface\n",
    "1. Once the debugger starts, the program will run until it hits the first breakpoint.\n",
    "2. When execution pauses, the **Debug** tool window will appear at the bottom of the PyCharm interface. This window provides various options and information:\n",
    "   - **Variables**: Shows the current variable values.\n",
    "   - **Frames**: Displays the call stack, allowing you to navigate through the function calls.\n",
    "   - **Watches**: You can add expressions to monitor their values as you step through the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Step Through the Code\n",
    "1. **Step Over (F8)**: Execute the current line and move to the next line in the same function. Use this when you want to skip over function calls without entering them.\n",
    "2. **Step Into (F7)**: If the current line contains a function call, this will take you into that function to debug it line by line.\n",
    "3. **Step Out (Shift + F8)**: Finish the current function and return to the calling function.\n",
    "4. **Resume Program (F9)**: Continue running the code until the next breakpoint or until the program finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Inspect Variables\n",
    "1. **Hover Over Variables**: While execution is paused, you can hover over variables in your code to see their current values.\n",
    "2. **Watch Variables**: In the **Watches** panel, you can add expressions or variable names to monitor their values continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Modify Variables\n",
    "1. While the execution is paused, you can change the value of variables in the **Variables** panel. This can help you test different scenarios without restarting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Remove Breakpoints\n",
    "1. To remove a breakpoint, click on the red dot in the gutter again, or right-click the line and select **Remove Breakpoint**.\n",
    "2. You can also disable breakpoints without removing them by clicking on the **Breakpoints** icon in the Debugger panel and unchecking the specific breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tips\n",
    "- **Conditional Breakpoints**: Right-click on a breakpoint and choose **Edit Breakpoint** to add conditions. The program will only pause if the condition evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "- **Log Message Breakpoints**: You can configure a breakpoint to log a message to the console instead of pausing execution.\n"
