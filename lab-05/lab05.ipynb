    "# Lab 5: Conditionals and Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Understand how to use conditional statements in Python.\n",
    "- Learn about flow control mechanisms such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n",
    "- Practice writing programs that utilize conditionals.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Syntax of Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "elif another_condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if the previous conditions were false and this condition is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to execute if none of the conditions were true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exercise 1: Simple Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the number is even or odd\n",
    "if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(f\"{number} is even.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"{number} is odd.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest conditionals to check multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "    if age >= 65:\n",
    "        print(\"You are a senior citizen.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exercise 2: Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Write a program that determines whether a person is a child, adult, or senior based on their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a child.\")\n",
    "elif age < 65:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a senior citizen.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Flow Control: `if` with Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature = 30\n",
    "is_raining = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 20 and not is_raining:\n",
    "    print(\"It's a nice day!\")\n",

    "## 6. Exercise 3: Flow Control with Logical Operators\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "Write a program that checks if a person is eligible for a discount based on their age and membership status.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "is_member = input(\"Are you a member? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n",
