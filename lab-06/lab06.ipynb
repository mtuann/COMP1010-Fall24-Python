    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand how to create and manipulate lists in Python.\n",
    "- Practice using list methods and accessing elements.\n",
    "- Introduction to objects and methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Section 1: Working with Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Creating a List\n",
    "A **list** is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. You can create a list using square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a list of fruits\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\n",
    "print(\"List of fruits:\", fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Accessing List Elements\n",
    "Lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`. You can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Access the first and the last element of the list\n",
    "print(\"First fruit:\", fruits[0])\n",
    "print(\"Last fruit:\", fruits[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Modifying List Elements\n",
    "Lists are **mutable**, which means you can change their elements by assigning new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Changing the second fruit to blueberry\n",
    "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"\n",
    "print(\"Updated list of fruits:\", fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 List Slicing\n",
    "You can use **slicing** to access a range of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Slicing the list to get a subset of elements\n",
    "print(\"First three fruits:\", fruits[:3])  # From index 0 to 2\n",
    "print(\"Fruits from index 2 to 4:\", fruits[2:4])  # From index 2 to 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Adding Elements to a List\n",
    "To add new elements, use `append()` to add to the end of the list or `insert()` to add at a specific position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding an element at the end of the list\n",
    "fruits.append(\"fig\")\n",
    "print(\"List after appending fig:\", fruits)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inserting an element at a specific index\n",
    "fruits.insert(2, \"grape\")\n",
    "print(\"List after inserting grape at index 2:\", fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Removing Elements from a List\n",
    "You can remove elements using `remove()`, `pop()`, or the `del` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Removing an element by value\n",
    "fruits.remove(\"date\")\n",
    "print(\"List after removing date:\", fruits)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing an element by index and returning it\n",
    "removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)\n",
    "print(\"Removed fruit:\", removed_fruit)\n",
    "print(\"List after pop:\", fruits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7 List Length\n",
    "The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting the length of the list\n",
    "print(\"Length of the list:\", len(fruits))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.8 Iterating Over a List\n",
    "You can use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating over the list and printing each fruit\n",
    "print(\"Fruits in the list:\")\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Introduction to Objects and Classes\n",
    "In Python, everything is an **object**, and objects belong to **classes**. You can define your own class using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defining a simple class to represent a Book object\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):\n",
    "        self.title = title\n",
    "        self.author = author\n",
    "        self.pages = pages\n",
    "\n",
    "    # A method to get information about the book\n",
    "    def get_info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.title} by {self.author}, {self.pages} pages\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Book class\n",
    "book1 = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\", 328)\n",
    "print(\"Book info:\", book1.get_info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Students will learn about classes and objects in Python, including how to define a class, create instances of a class, and access attributes and methods of objects in a later lesson. This section provides a brief introduction to the concept of objects and classes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Attributes and Methods\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to an object, while methods are functions that belong to an object. You can access attributes directly or use methods to manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing attributes directly\n",
    "print(\"Book title:\", book1.title)\n",
    "print(\"Book author:\", book1.author)\n",
    "print(\"Book pages:\", book1.pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying an attribute\n",
    "book1.pages = 350\n",
    "print(\"Updated book info:\", book1.get_info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Creating Multiple Instances\n",
    "You can create multiple instances of a class, each with its own attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating multiple instances of the Book class\n",
    "book2 = Book(\"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Harper Lee\", 281)\n",
    "book3 = Book(\"The Great Gatsby\", \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\", 180)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Book 2 info:\", book2.get_info())\n",
    "print(\"Book 3 info:\", book3.get_info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: List of Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Creating a List of Objects\n",
    "You can store objects in a list and use a loop to access their methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Storing Book objects in a list\n",
    "library = [book1, book2, book3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating over the list of books and printing their information\n",
    "print(\"Books in the library:\")\n",
    "for book in library:\n",
    "    print(book.get_info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Simple List Comprehension\n",
    "List comprehensions allow you to create lists in a concise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a list of squared numbers using list comprehension\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(\"Squared numbers:\", squared_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Filtering with List Comprehension\n",
    "You can also add conditions to a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a list of even numbers using list comprehension\n",
    "even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5: Lab Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This is optional content for students to practice using lists, objects, and list comprehensions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1: List Operations\n",
    "1. Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.\n",
    "2. Print the square of each number.\n",
    "3. Remove all odd numbers from the list.\n",
    "4. Add 11 to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solution to Exercise 1\n",
    "integers = list(range(1, 11))\n",
    "print(\"List of integers:\", integers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Squaring each integer\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in integers]\n",
    "print(\"Squares of integers:\", squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing odd numbers\n",
    "integers = [x for x in integers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(\"Even integers:\", integers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding 11 to the list\n",
    "integers.append(11)\n",
    "print(\"List after adding 11:\", integers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2: Creating and Using a Class\n",
    "1. Create a `Car` class with attributes `brand`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
    "2. Add a method `car_info()` to return the car's details.\n",
    "3. Create three instances of the class, store them in a list, and print each car's details.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solution to Exercise 2\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def car_info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}, {self.year}\"\n",
