    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand how to use loops (for and while) to iterate through lists.\n",
    "- Practice different ways of iterating over lists in Python.\n",
    "- Learn how to apply loops for various operations on lists, such as searching, counting, and modifying list elements.\n",

    "### Section 1: Lists and `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Introduction to `for` Loops with Lists\n",
    "A `for` loop in Python allows you to iterate over all elements of a list easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A simple for loop that prints each element in a list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `for` loop goes through each element of the `numbers` list and prints it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Using `range()` with `for` Loops\n",
    "You can also use the `range()` function to loop through a sequence of numbers, which can be useful when you want to use the index of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using range() to loop through indices of the list\n",
    "for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "    print(f\"Index {i}: {numbers[i]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range(len(numbers))` gives us a sequence of indices, and we can use it to access list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Modifying a List with `for` Loops\n",
    "We can use a `for` loop to modify elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Doubling each number in the list\n",
    "for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n",
    "print(\"List after doubling:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Be cautious when modifying a list while iterating through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Lists and `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Introduction to `while` Loops with Lists\n",
    "A `while` loop continues until a condition becomes false. You can use it to iterate over a list based on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a while loop to print all elements in the list\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(numbers):\n",
    "    print(numbers[index])\n",
    "    index += 1  # Move to the next element\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `while` loop goes through each element of the list based on the `index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 `while` Loop for Searching in a List\n",
    "A common use of a `while` loop is to search for a specific element in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Searching for a number in the list using a while loop\n",
    "target = 8\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "found = False\n",
    "\n",
    "while index < len(numbers) and not found:\n",
    "    if numbers[index] == target:\n",
    "        found = True\n",
    "        print(f\"Found {target} at index {index}\")\n",
    "    index += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "if not found:\n",
    "    print(f\"{target} not found in the list\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Nested Loops with Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Nested `for` Loops\n",
    "A **nested loop** is when a loop runs inside another loop. You can use this to work with 2D lists or perform operations involving multiple lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a nested loop: Multiplication table\n",
    "for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop\n",
    "    for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop\n",
    "        print(f\"{i} x {j} = {i * j}\")\n",
    "    print()  # Blank line after each row\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested loops allow you to combine elements or perform operations like matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Practical Examples of List Operations with Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Counting Elements in a List\n",
    "You can use a `for` loop to count how many times a certain element appears in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Counting the occurrences of the number 8 in the list\n",
    "numbers = [2, 4, 8, 8, 10, 12, 8]\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == 8:\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Number 8 appears {count} times in the list\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Finding the Maximum Value in a List\n",
    "Use a `for` loop to find the maximum value in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Finding the maximum value in a list\n",
    "numbers = [2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 3]\n",
    "max_num = numbers[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num > max_num:\n",
    "        max_num = num\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"The maximum value in the list is: {max_num}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Summing the Elements of a List\n",
    "You can sum all the numbers in a list using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Summing all numbers in the list\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    total += num\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"The sum of the numbers in the list is: {total}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 Using List Comprehensions\n",
    "List comprehensions offer a concise way to create lists. You can also use them to apply transformations to list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Doubling all numbers in a list using list comprehension\n",
    "doubled_numbers = [num * 2 for num in numbers]\n",
    "print(\"Doubled numbers:\", doubled_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
