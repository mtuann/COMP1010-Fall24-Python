    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of **tuples** and how they differ from lists.\n",
    "- Learn how to create and manipulate **dictionaries**.\n",
    "- Practice accessing and modifying data in dictionaries.\n",
    "- Explore use cases where tuples and dictionaries are useful in programming.\n",

    "### Section 1: Tuples in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Introduction to Tuples\n",
    "A **tuple** is an immutable collection of ordered elements. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a tuple\n",
    "coordinates = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "print(\"Tuple of coordinates:\", coordinates)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, days of the week, or color codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Accessing Elements in a Tuple\n",
    "You can access elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing elements in a tuple\n",
    "print(\"First coordinate:\", coordinates[0])\n",
    "print(\"Last coordinate:\", coordinates[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Tuple Unpacking\n",
    "You can **unpack** a tuple by assigning its elements to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Unpacking the tuple into variables\n",
    "x, y, z = coordinates\n",
    "print(f\"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Immutability of Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are **immutable**, meaning you cannot change their elements after creation. Any attempt to modify a tuple will result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Trying to change an element in a tuple (this will raise an error)\n",
    "# coordinates[0] = 50  # Uncommenting this line will result in a TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Tuples vs Lists\n",
    "The key difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, while lists are mutable. Use tuples when you want to ensure data cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Dictionaries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Introduction to Dictionaries\n",
    "A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a dictionary\n",
    "student = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 20,\n",
    "    \"major\": \"Computer Science\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(\"Student dictionary:\", student)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `\"name\"`, `\"age\"`, and `\"major\"` are the keys, and `\"Alice\"`, `20`, and `\"Computer Science\"` are the corresponding values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Accessing Dictionary Values\n",
    "You can access values in a dictionary using their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing values by their keys\n",
    "print(\"Student name:\", student[\"name\"])\n",
    "print(\"Student age:\", student[\"age\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Modifying Dictionary Values\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, so you can change the values associated with keys or add new key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Changing a value in the dictionary\n",
    "student[\"age\"] = 21\n",
    "print(\"Updated age:\", student[\"age\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "student[\"graduation_year\"] = 2025\n",
    "print(\"Updated student dictionary:\", student)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Dictionary Methods\n",
    "Dictionaries come with various built-in methods, such as `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, and `get()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting all keys in the dictionary\n",
    "print(\"Keys:\", student.keys())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting all values in the dictionary\n",
    "print(\"Values:\", student.values())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the get() method to safely access a key's value\n",
    "print(\"Major:\", student.get(\"major\"))\n",
    "print(\"Graduation year:\", student.get(\"graduation_year\", \"N/A\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Iterating Over Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Iterating Over Keys\n",
    "You can use a `for` loop to iterate over the keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating over keys in the dictionary\n",
    "for key in student:\n",
    "    print(f\"{key}: {student[key]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Iterating Over Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "You can use the `items()` method to iterate over both keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating over key-value pairs\n",
    "for key, value in student.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Tuples as Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary because they are immutable. This is useful when you want to represent data that has multiple attributes as a single key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a tuple as a dictionary key\n",
    "location_dict = {\n",
    "    (10.5, 25.3): \"Point A\",\n",
    "    (40.7, 90.5): \"Point B\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing a value using a tuple key\n",
    "print(\"Location of (10.5, 25.3):\", location_dict[(10.5, 25.3)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5: Lab Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1: Tuple Operations\n",
    "1. Create a tuple that contains the names of five cities.\n",
    "2. Print the second and fourth cities in the tuple.\n",
    "3. Use tuple unpacking to assign the cities to separate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solution to Exercise 1\n",
    "cities = (\"New York\", \"London\", \"Tokyo\", \"Sydney\", \"Paris\")\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3: Dictionary Search\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades.\n",
    "2. Write a loop that checks if a given student (e.g., \"Alice\") exists in the dictionary and prints their grade if found.\n",
    "3. If the student is not found, print \"Student not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solution to Exercise 3\n",
    "grades = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": 90,\n",
    "    \"Bob\": 85,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4: Nested Dictionary\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing their age and major.\n",
    "2. Write a loop to print each student's name along with their age and major.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Solution to Exercise 4\n",
    "students = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 20, \"major\": \"Computer Science\"},\n",
