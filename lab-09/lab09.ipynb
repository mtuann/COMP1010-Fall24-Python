    "### Lab 09: Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of sorting and why it is useful in programming.\n",
    "- Learn how to use Python’s built-in sorting methods: `sorted()` and `.sort()`.\n",
    "- Explore different ways to customize sorting using key functions and lambda expressions.\n",
    "- Practice implementing simple sorting algorithms (e.g., selection sort, bubble sort).\n",

    "### Section 1: Introduction to Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 What is Sorting?\n",
    "Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order. This is commonly ascending or descending order. Sorting is useful in searching, organizing data, and optimizing certain algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Built-in Sorting Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Using `sorted()`\n",
    "The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from any iterable (e.g., list, tuple).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using sorted() to sort a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [5, 3, 8, 6, 2, 7]\n",
    "sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n",
    "print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n",
    "print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note:** The `sorted()` function does not modify the original list. It returns a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Using `.sort()`\n",
    "The `.sort()` method sorts a list in place, meaning it modifies the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using sort() to sort the original list\n",
    "numbers.sort()\n",
    "print(\"List after sort():\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Sorting in Descending Order\n",
    "You can sort in descending order by passing the `reverse=True` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sorting in descending order\n",
    "sorted_numbers_desc = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\n",
    "print(\"Sorted in descending order:\", sorted_numbers_desc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Custom Sorting with `key`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Sorting by String Length\n",
    "You can customize the sorting behavior by using the `key` parameter. The `key` parameter expects a function that will be applied to each element before sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sorting strings by their length\n",
    "words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n",
    "sorted_by_length = sorted(words, key=len)\n",
    "print(\"Sorted by length:\", sorted_by_length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Sorting with `lambda` Functions\n",
    "You can pass a custom function or use a **lambda function** to sort based on more complex criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sorting tuples by the second element\n",
    "tuples = [(1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 1)]\n",
    "sorted_tuples = sorted(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "print(\"Sorted by second element:\", sorted_tuples)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Implementing Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Selection Sort\n",
    "In **selection sort**, the algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Selection Sort implementation\n",
    "def selection_sort(arr):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "        min_idx = i\n",
    "        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n",
    "            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n",
    "                min_idx = j\n",
    "        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n",
    "selection_sort(numbers)\n",
    "print(\"Selection sorted list:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Bubble Sort\n",
    "In **bubble sort**, adjacent elements are repeatedly swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bubble Sort implementation\n",
    "def bubble_sort(arr):\n",
    "    n = len(arr)\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n",
    "            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n",
    "                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n",
    "bubble_sort(numbers)\n",
    "print(\"Bubble sorted list:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Efficiency of Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "Both selection sort and bubble sort have time complexity of O(n²), which makes them inefficient for large datasets. However, Python's built-in sorting functions use **Timsort**, which is much more efficient (O(n log n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
