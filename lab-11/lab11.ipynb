    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "- Learn how to define classes and create objects in Python.\n",
    "- Understand the concept of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) within a class.\n",
    "- Practice using constructors and the `self` parameter.\n",
    "- Learn about encapsulation and access control using public and private attributes.\n",

    "### Section 1: Introduction to OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which contain both **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods). OOP helps to structure programs by bundling related data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Key Concepts of OOP\n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.\n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class.\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Variables that store data related to the object.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions that operate on the object's data.\n",

    "### Section 2: Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Creating a Simple Class\n",
    "Let’s create a simple class called `Dog`. This class will have attributes like `name` and `age`, and a method to make the dog bark.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defining the Dog class\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Attribute: name\n",
    "        self.age = age  # Attribute: age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):  # Method\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Creating Objects (Instances of a Class)\n",
    "Once we have defined the class, we can create objects (instances of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Dog class\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "print(f\"My dog's name is {my_dog.name} and he is {my_dog.age} years old.\")\n",
    "my_dog.bark()  # Calling the bark method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Methods and the `self` Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Understanding `self`\n",
    "In Python, `self` is a reference to the current object (instance) of the class. It allows access to the attributes and methods of the class. All methods in a class need to have `self` as the first parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Adding More Methods\n",
    "Let’s add a method to the `Dog` class that allows us to change the dog’s age.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding a method to update age\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update_age(self, new_age):\n",
    "        self.age = new_age\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} is now {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the new method\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "my_dog.update_age(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Encapsulation and Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Public and Private Attributes\n",
    "In Python, attributes are **public** by default, which means they can be accessed and modified from outside the class. We can make attributes private by prefixing their name with two underscores (`__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Encapsulating the Dog class with private attributes\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__age = age  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.__name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "        self.__name = new_name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing private attributes through methods\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "print(\"Dog's name:\", my_dog.get_name())\n",
    "my_dog.set_name(\"Max\")\n",
    "print(\"Dog's new name:\", my_dog.get_name())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5: Constructors (`__init__` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1 Understanding the Constructor\n",
    "The `__init__` method is the **constructor** in Python. It gets called automatically when an object is created and is used to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 Example: Car Class with Constructor\n",
    "Let’s create a `Car` class with a constructor to initialize attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Car class with constructor\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def car_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car Info: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "my_car.car_info()\n",
