    "### Lab 12: Object-Oriented Programming (Subclasses and Inheritance)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- Learn how to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class.\n",
    "- Understand method overriding in subclasses.\n",
    "- Explore the `super()` function to access methods from the parent class.\n",
    "- Practice creating hierarchies of classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1: Introduction to Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 What is Inheritance?\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a **new class** (subclass/child class) can inherit properties and methods from an **existing class** (parent class/base class). This allows for code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent class**: The class being inherited from (also called a base class or superclass).\n",
    "- **Child class**: The class that inherits from the parent class (also called a subclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Example: Inheriting from a Parent Class\n",
    "Let's define a simple `Animal` class as a parent class, and create a `Dog` subclass that inherits from `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Calling the parent class's constructor\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Dog class\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "my_dog.speak()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 What is Method Overriding?\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows a subclass to alter or extend the functionality of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Overriding the speak() method\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Cat class\n",
    "my_cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "my_cat.speak()  # This will call the overridden method in the Cat class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Using `super()` to Access Parent Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Why Use `super()`?\n",
    "The `super()` function allows you to call methods of the parent class from within a subclass. It is especially useful when the subclass needs to extend or modify the functionality of a parent method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using super() to extend the speak method\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent constructor\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        super().speak()  # Call the parent speak method\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name}, a {self.breed}, says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object and calling the method\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "my_dog.speak()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 4: Inheritance and Multiple Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Multi-level Inheritance\n",
    "A class can inherit from another class, and then another class can inherit from it. This creates a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Multi-level inheritance example\n",
    "class Mammal(Animal):\n",
    "    def feed_baby(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} feeds its baby.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Mammal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Dog class\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "my_dog.feed_baby()\n",
    "my_dog.speak()\n",
    "```\n",
