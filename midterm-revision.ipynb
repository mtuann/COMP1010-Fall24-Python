    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive review of the key concepts covered in Labs 2 to 7, preparing students for the midterm exam. Each section includes definitions, code examples, and practice questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 2: Expressions, Variable Assignments, and Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Expressions\n",
    "An expression is a combination of values and operators that can be evaluated to produce another value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Arithmetic expressions\n",
    "result = (5 + 3) * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Variable Assignments\n",
    "Variables are used to store data values. You can assign values to variables using the `=` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Logical Operators\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
    "- `and`\n",
    "- `or`\n",
    "- `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = True\n",
    "b = False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using logical operators\n",
    "if a and not b:\n",
    "    print(\"Condition met\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. What is the output of the following expression: `3 * (2 + 5)`?\n",
    "2. Write a variable assignment for your age and print it.\n",
    "3. Create a logical expression using `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 3: Functions & Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Functions\n",
    "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Modules\n",
    "Modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. Use the `import` statement to include a module in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Define a function `multiply(a, b)` that returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "2. What will happen if you try to use a function before defining it?\n",
    "3. Create a simple module that includes a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 4: Strings, Testing and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Strings\n",
    "Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They can be manipulated using various methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(text.lower())  # Output: hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Testing and Debugging\n",
    "Testing ensures your code works as expected. Debugging helps identify and fix errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Testing a function\n",
    "def is_even(n):\n",
    "    return n % 2 == 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Debugging\n",
    "print(is_even(4))  # Expected: True\n",
    "print(is_even(3))  # Expected: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Write a string that contains your name and print its length.\n",
    "2. Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.\n",
    "3. Discuss a debugging technique you can use when your code doesnâ€™t work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 5: Conditionals and Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Conditionals\n",
    "Conditionals allow you to execute code based on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Flow Control\n",
    "Flow control statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` help manage the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Write a program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "2. Create a grading system that assigns letter grades based on a numeric score.\n",
    "3. How does the `elif` statement differ from the `if` statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 6: Lists and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lists\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. You can create and manipulate lists using various methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.append(\"orange\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Objects\n",
    "Objects are instances of classes, which can encapsulate data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Rex\")\n",
    "print(my_dog.bark())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab 7: Lists, Iteration, and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Iteration\n",
    "Iteration allows you to execute a block of code multiple times. The `for` and `while` loops are commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a `for` loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a `while` loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Write a `for` loop to print all even numbers from 1 to 20.\n",
    "2. Create a `while` loop that sums numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "3. Explain the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Midterm Preparation\n",
    "- Review and practice coding exercises related to each topic.\n",
    "- Ensure you understand the concepts and can explain them in your own words.\n",
    "- Work on sample problems and previous assignments to reinforce learning."
